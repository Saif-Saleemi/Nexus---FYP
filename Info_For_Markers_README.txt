As the project has been created using Unity which contains alot of unessessary 
files for markers I would like to make navigating the files easier for the marker.

Where to find Code? - Code and Scenes can be found at PROJECT\Nexus_Early_Deliverable\Assets

The Final build for the early_deliverable can be found at PROJECT\Nexus_Early_Deliverable_Build

The Interim Report file is a start to the Final report, setting out the general layout for it for future use.
This file also contains a combination of all the reports made during this term so they are all in one place.


Diary.md is the diary used during the project, documenting my progression overtime as well as my weekly goals.

Demonstration.mkv is a demonstration of the early deliverable.

Thank you for reading!
